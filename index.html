          <h3>More Facts</h3>
          <p id="catFact">
            The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house
            cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only
            domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology
            and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred
            in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and
            working cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human
            contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to
            kill vermin.
