    `Cats use their long tails to maintain balance, allowing them to walk on various narrow surfaces, 
    like the tops of doors or fences. Their tail movements can also communicate different emotions, 
    such as interest, friendliness, and fear. Cats are one of the most popular pets on the planet, 
    but unlike dogs, humans havent had a large hand in selectively breeding the species. 
    Instead, we developed a relationship with cats over thousands of years thanks to our need to stop 
    rodents from eating our food and cats natural desire to catch and eat rodents.`;
